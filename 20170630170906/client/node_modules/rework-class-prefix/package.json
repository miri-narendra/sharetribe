  "readme": "# Rework Class Prefix\n\nAdd a class prefix to further sandbox CSS styling for third-party imports.\n\nThis comes in handy when you want to import two different CSS modules that might\nhave conflictings styles. For example, if module A and module B both have a\n`.media` class selector that have different use cases, you can run them through\n`rework-class-prefix` and result in something like `.a-media` and `.b-media`.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save rework-class-prefix\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar fs          = require('fs'),\n    rework      = require('rework'),\n    classPrefix = require('rework-class-prefix');\n\nvar css = fs.readFileSync('./some-css-file.css', 'utf-8');\n\ncss = rework(css)\n  .use(classPrefix('.my-prefix-'))\n  .toString();\n\nfs.writeFileSync('./prefixed-css-file.css', css, 'utf-8');\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* Leverages <https://github.com/intesso/rework-walk>.\n* Built on top of <https://github.com/reworkcss/rework>.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.
